   :local:

Version 0.11: There will be no 0.11
===================================
 
.. Warning::

   Development on this project has ceased. There will be no 0.11.


Version 0.10.3: March 4th, 2015
===============================

**Changes:**

* Added support for terms_stats facet.


Version 0.10.2: October 10th, 2014
==================================

.. Note::

   This has been tested with Elasticsearch 0.90 up through 1.3.4.
   We don't support versions of earlier than 0.90.

   This supports elasticsearch-py >= 1.0.

   This is a bridging release to help people migrate from Elasticsearch
   <= 0.90 to Elasticsearch >= 1.0.

   The next version of ElasticUtils will not support versions of
   Elasticsearch < 1.0.

**Changes:**

* Fixed monkeypatch to work with all bulk op_types (e.g. insert,
  create, update and delete)


Version 0.10.1: September 22nd, 2014
====================================

.. Note::

   This supports Elasticsearch 0.90, 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. It doesn't
   support versions earlier than 0.90 or later than 1.2.

   This supports elasticsearch-py >= 1.0.

   This is a bridging release to help people migrate from Elasticsearch
   <= 0.90 to Elasticsearch >= 1.0.

   The next version of ElasticUtils will not support versions of
   Elasticsearch < 1.0.


**API-breaking changes:**

* **requires elasticsearch-py >= 1.0**

**Changes:**

* Add distance filter

* Fix tests to work with Elasticsearch 1.2

* Invert monkeypatch for bulk indexing

* Fix infinite recursion when pickling MappingType instances

* Invert monkeypatch--ElasticUtils now requires elasticsearch-py >= 1.0


Version 0.10: August 19th, 2014
===============================

.. Note::

   This version supports Elasticsearch 0.90, 1.0 and 1.1. It does not
   support versions earlier than 0.90 or later than 1.1.

   ElasticUtils 0.10 does not work with elasticsearch-py > 0.4.5.

   This is a bridging release to help people migrate from Elasticsearch
   <= 0.90 to Elasticsearch >= 1.0.

   The next version of ElasticUtils will not support versions of
   Elasticsearch < 1.0.


**API-breaking changes:**

* **big ``.values_list()`` and ``.values_dict()`` changes**

  ``.values_list()`` and ``.values_dict()`` will now **always** specify
  the Elasticsearch ``fields`` property.

  If you call these two functions with no arguments (i.e. you specify
  no fields), they will send ``fields=*`` to Elasticsearch. It will
  send any fields marked as stored in the document mapping. If you
  have no fields marked as stored, then it will return the id and type
  of the result.

  If you call these two functions with arguments (i.e. you specify
  fields), then it'll return those fields---same as before.

  However, they now return all values as lists. For example::

      >>> S().values_list()
      [([100], ['bob'], [40]), ...]

      >>> S().values_list('id')
      [([100],), ([101],), ...]

      >>> S().values_dict()
      [({'id': [100], 'name': ['bob'], 'weight': [40]}), ...]

      >>> S().values_dict('id', 'name')
      [({'id': [100], 'name': ['bob']}), ...]

* Removed ``text`` and ``text_phrase`` queries. They're renamed
  in Elasticsearch to ``match`` and ``match_phrase``.

* Removed ``startswith`` query. Replace uses of it with ``prefix``.

**Changes:**

* Python 3 support (Python >= 3.3)

* Supports Elasticsearch 0.90, 1.0 and 1.1


Version 0.9.1: April 7th, 2014
==============================

**Changes:**

* **Fixed bug with facets that are both sized and filtered**


Version 0.9: April 3rd, 2014
============================

.. Note::

   This is a *big* change. We switched from pyelasticsearch to
   elasticsearch-py. The Elasticsearch object you get back from
   ``get_es`` is pretty different. When you upgrade to ElasticUtils
   v0.9, you'll probably need to rewrite code.

   If this terrifies you, read through these notes carefully and/or
   stay with ElasticUtils v0.8.


.. Note::

   This version supports Elasticsearch 0.20 through 0.90. It does not
   yet support Elasticsearch 1.0. Support for 1.0 and later will be in
   a later version of ElasticUtils.


**API-breaking changes:**

* **elasticsearch-py >= v0.4.3 and < 1.0 required.**

  ElasticUtils now uses elasticsearch-py.

  .. Note::

     You have to use elasticsearch-py >= v0.4.3 and < 1.0. ElasticUtils
     does not support elasticsearch-py 1.0. Support for later versions
     will come in a future ElasticUtils release.

* **pyelasticsearch no longer needed**

  You can remove pyelasticsearch and its requirements.

* **thrift now supported!**

  elasticsearch-py supports http, thrift and memcache protocols, so
  you can use any of them now.

* **pyelasticsearch -> elasticsearch-py changes.**

  If you called ``elasticutils.get_es()`` and got a pyelasticsearch
  `ElasticSearch` object and did things with that (create index, create
  mappings, delete indexes, indexing, cluster health, ...), you're going
  to need to make some changes.

  You can either:

  1. rewrite that code to use elasticsearch-py `Elasticsearch`
     equivalents, or

  2. write a different function that returns a pyelasticsearch `ElasticSearch`
     object and use that

  Rewriting shouldn't be too hard. The `elasticsearcy-py documentation
  <https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ is pretty good
  and for most things, there's a 1-to-1 translation. Also, in many cases
  it's cleaner, so you'll probably be removing code.

* **S.all() no longer returns all results**

  If you were using `S.all()` to return all search results, you should
  change it to `S.everything()`.

* **`S._build_query()` was changed to `S.build_search()`**

  This makes the method public and also changes the name and documentation
  to be more correct.

  If you really need a `S._build_query()`, add it to your `S` subclass.

* **Search results metadata is now in the `es_meta` object**

  Previously, you would access search results metadata like this::

      obj._id
      obj._highlight
      obj._score

      etc.


  In order to make those accessible in Django templates, we moved them into
  an es_meta object. You can now access them like this::

      obj.es_meta.id
      obj.es_meta.highlight
      obj.es_meta.score

      etc.


**Changes:**

* **added S.everything() which does what S.all() did**

* **index_objects celery task can now take es and index args**

* **unindex_objects celery task can now take es and index args**

* **added S.suggestions() support**

* **added S.query_and_fetch() support**

* **added S.search_type()**

* **S.facet() can now take a size keyword argument**

* **S.facet_couts() now returns a dict of FacetResults objects**

  The FacetResults object contains all the data we get back
  from that section in the Elasticsearch response.

* **SearchResults now has facet data in facets property**

* **elasticutils.estestcase.ESTestCase available and cleaned up**

  Previously, it was in ``elasticutils/tests/__init__.py``. This
  makes it so everyone can use the same TestCase subclass we're
  using for our tests.


Version 0.8.2: January 6th, 2014
================================

**Changes:**

* **Allow pyelasticsearch 0.6.1.**

  This alleviates part of the problem in issue #163.

* **Add tox.ini file.**

  We're testing with Python 2.6 and 2.7 on Django 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6.

* **Add caching for empty results.**

  ElasticUtils will now correctly remember when it got no results from
  a search and won't redo the search.

* **Add support for query and filter facets.**

* **Attach facets to search result objects.**

* **order_by() accepts a dict as the sort field so you can do advanced sorts.**


Version 0.8.1: September 13th, 2013
===================================

**API-breaking changes:**

* **Indexable.index overwrite_existing argument default changed**

  In v0.8, we added the ``overwrite_existing`` argument, but made
  it default to False. That's different than what pyelasticsearch
  does.

  In v0.8.1, we changed the default to True which is in line with
  what pyelasticsearch does.

  If you were depending on the old behavior, then you need to
  update your indexing code to set ``overwrite_existing=False``.


Version 0.8: August 19th, 2013
==============================

**API-breaking changes:**

* **pyelasticsearch v0.6 or later now required.**

  Further, since pyelasticsearch has released versions that aren't
  backwards compatible, we're now pegging on specific versions.

* **celery 2.5.5 or later now required.**

  You can ignore this if you're not using the Django celery tasks.

* **Indexable.index arguments changed**

  pyelasticsearch changed arguments, so we did, too. We dropped
  the ``force_insert`` argument (which wasn't working) and picked
  up ``overwrite_existing``.

  ``overwrite_existing`` defaults to False which means it will
  **not** overwrite existing documents in the index.

  .. Note::

     This was a mistake since pyelasticsearch defaults to True.
     We changed this in 0.8.1.


**Changes:**

* **Added support for ``range`` queries and filters.**

  ``range`` is a nice shorthand for ``gte`` and ``lte``.

* **S.filter_raw added**

  If :py:meth:`elasticutils.S.filter` isn't doing as it's told, then you
  can skip it and use the Elasticsearch API to create the filter clause
  of the search by hand with :py:meth:`elasticutils.S.filter_raw`.

* Moved requirements files to ``requirements/``.


Version 0.7: Released June 12th, 2013
=====================================

.. Note::

   This is a *big* change. We switched from pyes to pyelasticsearch. In
   doing that, we changed a handful of signatures, nixed some
   functionality that didn't make any sense any more, and cleaned a
   bunch of things up.

   If this terrifies you, read through these notes carefully and/or
   stay with v0.6.


**API-breaking changes:**

* **pyelasticsearch v0.4 or later now required.**

  ElasticUtils now requires pyelasticsearch v0.4 or later and its
  requirements.

* **elasticutils.PYES_VERSION is removed.**

  Since we're not using pyes, we removed `elasticutils.PYES_VERSION`.

* **ElasticUtils no longer supports thrift.**

  Pretty sure we did a lousy job of supporting it before---it was all
  in the pyes code and we had no tests for it.

* **get_es() signatures have changed.**

  * takes urls now instead of hosts
  * dump_curl argument is now gone
  * default_indexes argument is gone

  The arguments correspond with pyelasticsearch `ElasticSearch`
  object.

  ElasticUtils uses HTTP urls for connecting to Elasticsearch now.
  Previously, you'd do::

      get_es(hosts=['localhost:9200'])        # Old way

  Now you do::

      get_es(urls=['http://localhost:9200'])  # New way

  The dump_curl argument was helpful for debugging, but we don't
  really need it anymore. See the :ref:`debugging-chapter` for better
  debugging methods.

  Will now raise a `DeprecationWarning` if you pass in `hosts`
  argument.

* **S searches all indexes and doctypes by default.**

  Previously, if you did::

      S()

  it'd search an index named "default" for doctypes "document". That
  was dumb. Now it searches all indexes and all doctypes by default.

* **S.es_builder is gone.**

  ``es_builder()`` was there to get around problems with pyes' ES
  class. The pyelasticsearch `ElasticSearch` class is more
  straightforward, so we don't need to do circus shenanigans.

  You can probably do what you need to with either the ``es()``
  transform or by subclassing `S` and overriding the ``get_es()``
  method.

* **MLT arguments changed.**

  The `fields` argument in the constructor was renamed to `mlt_fields`
  to be in line with Elasticsearch API names.

  Will now raise a `DeprecationWarning` if you pass in `fields`
  argument.

* **MappingType get_indexes renamed to get_index.**

  `MappingType` had a method called `get_indexes`. This is now
  `get_index` because it should return a single index name.

* **Added Indexable mixin for indexing bits for MappingTypes.**

* **Django: changed settings.**

  Changed ES_HOSTS setting to ES_URLS. This is both a name and a value
  change. ES_URLS takes a list of strings each is an http url. You'll
  neex to update your settings files from::

      ES_HOSTS = ['localhost:9200']        # Old way

  to::

      ES_URLS = ['http://localhost:9200']  # New way

  ES_DUMP_CURL is gone.

* **Django: removed the statsd code.**

* **Django: ESTestCase was improved, documented and bugs squashed.**

  It was improved, documented and bugs were squashed. It's now used by
  the test suite.

* **Django: Indexable.index() method no longer has bulk argument.**

  The `Indexable.index()` method no longer does bulk indexing. The
  way pyes did this was kind of squirrely and caused issues if you
  didn't have the order of operations correct.

  Now `Indexable.index()` only indexes a single document.

  But wait...

* **Django: Indexable now has bulk_index().**

  pyes would keep track of all the things you wanted to bulk index
  and then at some point push them all. Instead of doing it under the
  hood, we added a separate `bulk_index()` method and now you control
  how many items get indexed in bulk in one pass.

* **Django: Indexable.refresh_index no longer takes a timeout argument.**

  pyelasticsearch `ElasticSearch.refresh` doesn't take a timesleep
  argument, so we don't need that anymore.

* **Django: Indexable es argument defaults to Indexable.get_es() now.**

  Previously it defaulted to `elasticsearch.contrib.django.get_es()`. Now
  it defaults to `Indexable.get_es()` class method making it more flexible.

* **Django: renamed DjangoMappingType to MappingType.**

* **Django: moved MappingType and Indexable.**

  They were in ``elasticutils.contrib.django.models`` and are now in
  ``elasticutils.contrib.django``. Yay for slightly shorter module paths!

* **Django: ditched the cron module and its helpers.**

  It's not clear they ever worked (issue #21) and there are no tests.

* **pyes -> pyelasticsearch changes.**

  If you called ``.get_es()`` and got a pyes `ES` object and did
  things with that (create index, create mappings, delete indexes,
  indexing, cluster health, ...), you're going to need to make
  some changes.

  You can either:

  1. rewrite that code to use pyelasticsearch `ElasticSearch`
     equivalents, or

  2. write and use your own ``get_es()`` function that returns
     a pyes `ES` object

  Rewriting shouldn't be too hard. The `pyelasticsearch documentation
  <https://pyelasticsearch.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ is pretty good
  and for most things, there's a 1-to-1 translation.

**Changes:**

* **pyes is no longer a requirement.**

  We no longer use pyes so you can remove it from your requirements.

* **S.execute added**

  This allows you to explicitly execute a search and get back a
  `SearchResults` instance.

  See :py:meth:`elasticutils.S.execute` for details.

* **S.all added**

  Allows you to get **all** the search results possible rather than
  just the first 10 search results which is the default.

  You should consider using slices instead which allows you to
  specify the maximum number of results to get back.

  This is dangerous, so it's been documented with lots of warnings.

  See :py:meth:`elasticutils.S.all` for details.

* **Added support for ``match`` and ``match_phrase`` queries.**

  Elasticsearch 0.19.9 renamed text query to match query. This adds
  support for ``match`` and ``match_phrase``.

  See :ref:`queries-queries` for details.

* **Added support for ``wildcard`` and ``terms`` queries.**

  See :ref:`queries-queries` for details.

* **Reimplemented filter and query implementation.**

  The new implementations allow you to add handling for filters and
  queries that ElasticUtils doesn't handle as well as override what
  ElasticUtils does.

  See :py:class:`elasticutils.S` for details.

* **S.query_raw added**

  If :py:meth:`elasticutils.S.query` is getting you down, then you
  can skip it and use the Elasticsearch API to create the query clause
  of the search by hand with :py:meth:`elasticutils.S.query_raw`.

* **Django: es_required_or_50x handles different exceptions.**

  Previously it handled:

  * pyes.urllib3.MaxRetryError
  * pyes.exceptions.IndexMissingException
  * pyes.exceptions.ElasticSearchException

  We're not using pyes anymore, so now it handles:

  * pyelasticsearch.exceptions.ConnectionError
  * pyelasticsearch.exceptions.ElasticHttpError
  * pyelasticsearch.exceptions.ElasticHttpNotFoundError
  * pyelasticsearch.exceptions.InvalidJsonResponseError
  * pyelasticsearch.exceptions.Timeout

  You probably don't need to do anything about this, but it's good to
  know.

* **Django: celery tasks rewritten.**

  The celery tasks were rewritten, docs were updated, and tests were
  added so they work now.


Version 0.6: Released January 17th, 2013
========================================

**API-breaking changes:**

* **S.values_dict no longer always includes id.**

  ``values_dict`` no longer always includes an 'id' field in the
  fields list if you don't specify it.

  Specifying no fields now returns **all** fields::

      S().values_dict()

  Specifying fields now returns only those fields::

      S().values_dict('name', 'number')

* **S.values_list no longer always includes id.**

  ``values_list`` no longer always includes an 'id' field in the
  fields list if you don't specify it.

  Specifying no fields now returns **all** fields::

      S().values_list()

  Specifying fields now returns data for those fields in the order
  the fields are specified::

      S().values_list('name', 'number')

* **Types have changed.**

  This is a big change.

  Up through ElasticUtils v0.5, `S` could take a type and that type was
  a model. This is now completely different.

  In ElasticUtils v0.6 and later, `S` takes a `MappingType`. A
  `MappingType` can be related to a model, but it itself should not be
  a model. This allows us to return search results as a list of
  `MappingType` instances which can do things rather than forcing you
  to do a db hit to get back instances that can do things.

  This is similar to how django-haystack works with the SearchIndex
  class, except ElasticUtils doesn't yet support declarative mapping
  definition.

  See documentation for more details.

* **By default, results are now DefaultMappingType.**

  In ElasticUtils v0.4 and v0.5, if the `S` was untyped and you didn't
  specify either ``values_dict`` or ``values_list``, then the results
  would come back as a list of dicts.

  In ElasticUtils v0.5, if the `S` is untyped and you didn't specify
  either ``values_dict`` or ``values_list``, then the results would
  come back as a list of `DefaultMappingType`.

  See documentation for more details.

* **elasticutils.contrib.django.models.SearchMixin is no more.**

  The `SearchMixin` class is replaced by `DjangoMappingType` which
  relates Elasticsearch mapping types to Django ORM models and
  `Indexable` which is a mixin that adds a bunch of index-related
  infrastructure.

**Changes:**

* Added ``_source`` and ``_id`` to the metadata decorated on the
  search results.

  See documentation for more details.

* Fixed ``elasticutils.contrib.django.es_required_or_50x``.

  It works better now.

* prefix filter support.

  ElasticUtils supports prefix filters. You can do this now::

      S().filter(name__prefix='odin')


Version 0.5: Released September 4th, 2012
=========================================

**API-breaking changes:**

None.

**Changes:**

* Added ``demote`` transform: it adds boosting query support allowing
  you to do a negative query which reduces scores for documents that
  match.

* The elasticutils version is now available in ``elasticutils.__version__``
  as well as ``elasticutils._version.__version__``.

* Added ``__in`` support for queries. Doing::

      S().query(foo__in=['a', 'b', 'c'])

  does a terms query now.

* Added `MLT` class which does morelikethis.

* Added API documentation for S, an index, ``order_by`` docs, fixed some
  icky bugs, and generally improved everything at least a little bit.


Version 0.4: Released July 31st, 2012
=====================================

**API-breaking changes:**

* **ElasticUtils no longer requires Django.**

  If you're using Django, you should change your import statements
  from things like::

      from elasticutils import get_es, S, F

  to::

      from elasticutils.contrib.django import get_es, S, F

  Further, Django helper modules like ``cron``, ``tasks``, and
  ``models`` were all moved to ``elasticutils.contrib.django``.

  We moved `ESTestCase` from ``elasticutils.tests`` to
  ``elasticutils.contrib.django.estestcase``

  If you don't use Django, ElasticUtils is easier to use!

* **S no longer requires a type.**

  If you're not using Django, `S` no longer requires a type. If you
  don't specify a type, then ElasticUtils will return results as
  dicts.

* **Values and values_list changed.**

  ``values()`` was renamed to ``values_list()``.

  ``values_list()`` (was ``values()``) now always returns a list of
  tuples even if you only requested a single field. Previously, doing
  something like::

      searcher = S().values_list('id')

  would return something like::

      [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

  Now it returns::

      [(1,), (2,), (3,), (4,), (5,)]

* **Facet functionality was rewritten.**

  Changed ``.facet()`` to be arg-driven and allow for `filtered` and
  `global_` flags.

  Changed ``.facets()`` to ``.facet_counts()`` to match Django
  Haystack.

  Added ``.facet_raw()`` which allows you to do more complicated
  facets including scripting. This is similar to the original
  ``.facet()`` implementation.


**Changes:**

* Overhauled and cleaned up ElasticUtils tests. Running tests can be done
  with::

      DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=es_settings nosetests

* Default timeout was changed from 1 second to 5 seconds.

* Added ``es`` transform: it allows you to specify the settings with which
  to create an ES when the search is executed.

* Added ``es_builder`` transform: it allows you to specify a function
  that builds an ES which will be executed to create an ES when the
  search is executed.

* Added ``indexes`` transform: it allows you to specify the indexes to
  use for the search.

* Added ``doctypes`` transform: it allows you to specify the doctypes
  to use for the search.

* Added ``explain`` transform: it allows you to set the "explain" flag
  which gives you an explanation of how the score was calculated.

  I also added ``elasticutils.utils.format_elasticutils`` which formats
  the resulting explanation text into something slightly more
  readable. But it's likely this will change in the future.

* Added ``boost`` transform: it allows you to do query-time field
  boosting.

* Added support for ``prefix``. It's the same as ``startswith``, but
  it uses the same word that ElasticSearch uses. At some point, we'll
  remove support for ``startswith``.

* Added support for ``text_phrase`` and ``query_string`` queries.

* Added ``highlight`` transform: generates highlighted fragments of
  content that matched the query.

* Removed requirement for nuggets.

* Continued to improve documentation.


Version 0.3: Released June 1st, 2012
====================================

**Changes:**

* Add documentation for debugging, project details and other things.

* Minor project cleanup to make it easier to maintain and use

* Make ``get_es()`` more useful. It now takes overrides that allow you to
  configure multiple kinds of ES objects for different purposes.
